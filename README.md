## Default Hotkeys

Hotkey | Description
---|---
`alt+i` | Flip selection
`cmd+i` | Flip selection (macOS)

## Use Case

Sometimes I have a need to select whole function and its API docs at once, using keyboard only.

Currently I use a command to expand selection over the block/function but it puts the caret at the end. I need to put it back to beginning so I can continue selection upwards - this is when this extension comes handy.
